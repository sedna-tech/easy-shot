## INTRODUCTION

This Privacy Policy outlines the privacy practices concerning all information, data, graphics, content, software applications, and other browser extensions or services provided or made accessible through the Software or the Website. Hereinafter, the Software, the Website, and any other “EasyShot” services are referred to as the “Service”.

In this Privacy Policy, “we”, “us”, “our”, and other similar references mean Sedna Tech Limited, while “you”, “your”, and other similar references refer to any specific user of the Service.

We want to ensure that you are fully informed about our extension, “EasyShot”, so you understand your interaction with us. Please carefully read this Privacy Policy, as installing our extension or visiting our website implies your acceptance of the practices listed here.

## USER ACCOUNTS

Creating a user account or providing personal information is not necessary to use “EasyShot”.

## PERSONAL INFORMATION

“EasyShot” does not collect any personal information about you (such as your name, email address, etc.). Additionally, it does not collect or report data about your computer keystrokes or any data unrelated to the services the Extension provides, back to us or anyone else.

We do not access any APIs to obtain personal information, therefore there is no section in this privacy policy about sharing it.

## COOKIES

The Service uses “cookies” to enhance your online experience. A cookie is a text file placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. They are uniquely assigned to you and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie. We may use cookies to collect, store, and track information for statistical purposes to operate our Website and Services.

Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can typically adjust your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. However, if you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the features of the Website and Services or the Service as a whole.

## DATA

“EasyShot” uses local storage to save the user’s settings. All data are stored offline in your browser.

## ANALYTICS DATA

We do use, collect, or process Google Analytics data for improving our services.

## CHILDREN’S PRIVACY

We prioritize the protection of children while using the internet. We believe parents should be involved in their children’s online activities and encourage them to create a safe and friendly online environment for their children.

## CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY

“EasyShot” reserves the right to update this privacy policy at any time. When we do, we will update the date at the bottom of this page and send you an email.

We encourage users to frequently check this page for any changes to stay informed about how we protect the personal information we collect. You acknowledge and agree that it is your responsibility to review this privacy policy periodically and be aware of modifications.
